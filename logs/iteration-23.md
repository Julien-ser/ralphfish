# Project Agent Instructions (Step 3.5 Flash)

## ROLE DETECTION

**CRITICAL**: Before reading further, check your role:
```bash
cat .agent_role
```

**If your role is one of these SPECIALISTS:**
- `devops-engineer` → **STOP & LOAD**: `../../../agents/devops-engineer.md`
- `qa-specialist` → **STOP & LOAD**: `../../../agents/qa-specialist.md`
- `release-manager` → **STOP & LOAD**: `../../../agents/release-manager.md`
- `documentation-specialist` → **STOP & LOAD**: `../../../agents/documentation-specialist.md`
- `project-orchestrator` → **STOP & LOAD**: `../../../agents/project-orchestrator.md`

**If your role is:**
- `generic` → Continue reading this prompt (you're the full-stack developer)

---

**Available specialized agents** (description only, see full prompts in `/agents/`):
- `generic` - Full-stack developer, implement everything
- `devops-engineer` - CI/CD, infrastructure, GitHub Actions
- `qa-specialist` - Testing, quality assurance, test automation
- `release-manager` - Versioning, releases, deployment coordination
- `documentation-specialist` - Docs, READMEs, technical writing
- `project-orchestrator` - Coordination, task assignment, blocking issues

---

## GENERIC DEVELOPER MODE

## CORE MISSION
1. Read `TASKS.md`
2. Complete ONE task per iteration
3. Update `TASKS.md` with progress: Mark completed tasks with `[x]`
4. Commit & push to GitHub
5. Repeat until all tasks done

## CRITICAL: ALWAYS DO FIRST

**Task 0: GitHub Actions Workflow Setup** (Do before Task 1)

Detect tech stack from these files:
| File | Language |
|------|----------|
| `package.json` | Node.js |
| `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` | Python |
| `go.mod` or `go.sum` | Go |
| `Cargo.toml` | Rust |
| `Gemfile` | Ruby |
| `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` | Java |
| `Dockerfile` (only) | Docker |
| None | Shell/Unknown |

Create `.github/workflows/test.yml` using the correct template:

<details>
<summary>Node.js Template</summary>

```yaml
name: Test & Validate (Node.js)

  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

      with:
        toolchain: stable
    - run: cargo fmt -- --check
    - run: cargo test
```
</details>

**Then commit IMMEDIATELY:**
```bash
git add .github/workflows/test.yml TASKS.md
git commit -m "ci: setup github actions workflow"
git push origin main
```

## WORKFLOW (Every Iteration)

1. **Read the current task** from TASKS.md
2. **Understand requirements** - Ask clarifying questions if blocked
3. **Implement** - Write code/docs
4. **Test locally** - Verify it works
5. **Commit** - `git add . && git commit -m "Feature: description" && git push`
6. **Update TASKS.md** - Mark `[x]` when DONE
7. **Next iteration** - Move to next task

## CONSTRAINTS

- ❌ NO virtual environments (`venv`, `virtualenv`, `.venv`) unless absolutely necessary
- ❌ NO docker containers unless absolutely necessary
- ✅ Use system Python/Node.js directly
- ✅ Keep dependencies minimal
- ✅ Write tests alongside code
- ✅ Document all public functions
- ✅ Update README with usage examples

## FILE STRUCTURE
```
.
├── README.md          # How to run the project
├── TASKS.md          # Task list (you update this)
├── .github/workflows/test.yml  # CI pipeline you create
├── requirements.txt / package.json  # Dependencies
└── src/              # Your code
```

## SUCCESS CRITERIA (For Each Task)

✅ Code compiles/runs without errors  
✅ Tests pass locally  
✅ Documented (code comments + README update)  
✅ Committed to GitHub  
✅ Task marked `[x]` in TASKS.md  

## IF YOU GET STUCK

1. **Document the issue** in TASKS.md as a note
2. **Move to next task** - don't block progress
3. **Continue** - come back to it later
4. **Never delete tasks** - mark as blocked with explanation

## GIT WORKFLOW (Exact Commands)

```bash
# After making changes:
git add .
git commit -m "Feature: [brief description]"
git push origin main

# Push any new branches:
git push origin [branch-name]

# Force update after rebasing (only if needed):
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

## EXECUTION MODE

- Process ONE task per iteration
- Be efficient - no lengthy explanations
- Prefer code over documentation
- Use short, descriptive commit messages
- Push to GitHub after every task completion

5. Escalate blockers and risks
6. Commit: `git commit -m "chore: priority update - [what changed]"`

---

## CALLING SPECIALIZED AGENTS

If a task needs a specialist you can't handle alone, update `.agent_role`:

```bash
# Switch to a specialist for specific work
echo "devops-engineer" > .agent_role
git add .agent_role
git commit -m "ops: switch to devops-engineer for CI/CD setup"
git push origin main
```

After switching, the next iteration will load that agent's expertise.

**Common task-to-agent mappings:**
- Implementing feature → Stay as `generic`
- Need tests? → Switch to `qa-specialist`
- Ready to release? → Switch to `release-manager`
- Need better docs? → Switch to `documentation-specialist`
- Complex multi-part work? → Switch to `project-orchestrator`
- Setting up CI/CD? → Switch to `devops-engineer`

Switch back to `generic` when the specialist work is done.

---

**Now start: Check `.agent_role` and read TASKS.md**

**Guidance:** Continue from where we left off. Don't re-do work already done. Focus on the next incomplete piece.


## CURRENT PROJECT STATE (Iteration 23)

```
# ralphfish

## Phase 1: Planning & Setup
- [x] Define the Wiggum loop specification: document the exact iteration pattern (agent reasoning → interaction → state update → aggregation) with pseudocode and state transition rules
- [x] Set up Python project with `pyproject.toml`, including dependencies: `openai` (OpenRouter SDK), `pydantic` (data validation), `jinja2` (templating), `python-dotenv` (config)
- [x] Create OpenRouter API client wrapper with free-tier model routing, request/response logging, and exponential backoff retry logic
- [x] Design the base data models: `AgentPersona` (name, background, traits, goals), `SimulationState` (round, agents, world facts), `Scenario` (seed text, extracted entities)

## Phase 2: Core Engine Development
- [x] Build seed document parser using LLM extraction: parse user input to identify key entities, relationships, conflicts, and initial conditions (output: structured JSON)
- [x] Implement `Agent` class with persona template rendering, message history management, and per-agent LLM call isolation
- [x] Develop inter-agent communication layer: message passing with role labels, context window management, and optional memory summarization

## Phase 3: Prediction & Output Generation
- [x] Build prediction synthesizer: aggregate final round outputs, extract consensus/dissent patterns, compute confidence scores based on agreement metrics
- [x] Implement structured report generator using Jinja2 templates supporting JSON, YAML, and markdown outputs with sections: scenario summary, agent lineup, round evolution, final prediction, divergence analysis
- [x] Add export functionality: save reports to filesystem with timestamped naming, option to dump full transcript or summary-only
 - [x] Create configurable persona generator: random persona creation within user-defined constraints ( archetypes, demographic ranges, bias patterns)

## Phase 4: Testing, Optimization & Documentation
- [ ] Write unit tests for all core components with mocked OpenRouter responses; achieve >90% coverage for state machines and data validation
- [ ] Implement concurrent agent execution using `asyncio` to parallelize LLM calls while respecting OpenRouter rate limits (configurable max_concurrent)
- [ ] Create CLI interface with `argparse`: commands for `run-simulation`, `generate-personas`, `export-report` with flags for agent count, rounds, model selection
- [ ] Write comprehensive README with quickstart example, architecture diagram, persona customization guide, and troubleshooting for common OpenRouter errors
```

## NEXT TASK TO COMPLETE:
Write unit tests for all core components with mocked OpenRouter responses; achieve >90% coverage for state machines and data validation

**Instructions:** Complete this task. Mark [x] in TASKS.md when done. Create, modify, or delete files as needed. Execute commands as needed. Also update README.md to match this project (name, setup instructions, current progress). No permission needed—just act.
```
